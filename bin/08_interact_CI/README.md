## CI commands and CI list

These lists should create a link between the CI and the user. If certain models are displayed graphically or certain reference files are created or updated, these are to be written into the files "show_ref.txt" or "update_ref.txt" line by line. 

show_ref : Lists all mentioned reference results graphically.  
update_ref : Updates the model and the whole package in which the model is located.
