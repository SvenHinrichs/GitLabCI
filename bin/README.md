## What is CI?

Continuous integration is a term from software development that describes the process of continuously assembling components to form an application. 
The goal of continuous integration is to increase software quality.
Typical actions are translating and linking the application parts, but in principle any other operations to generate derived information are performed. 
Usually, not only the entire system is rebuilt, but also automated tests are performed and software metrics are created to measure software quality. 
The whole process is automatically triggered by checking into the version control system.

### How we use CI?
In our case we mirror a github repository in GitLab. This way the repository can be tested and corrected with the CI in Gitlab. 
We also use the Docker service to create an image containing Dymola and thus be able to simulate models in Dymola.

For more information read the [General Documentation](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/blob/master/bin/04_Documentation/Documentation_GitLab.md)
![E.ON EBC RWTH Aachen University](04_Documentation/Images/GITLABCI.png)
and the Repository [Dymola-Docker](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_intern/dymola-docker)

## What CI Tests are implement?
#### Check, Simulate and Regressiontest: [UnitTests](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/02_CITests/UnitTests)

With the help of these tests, models are validated or simulated and the models are compared and evaluated with stored values by means of a unit test. 

#### Correct HTML and Style Check: [SyntaxTest](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/02_CITests/SyntaxTests)

The documentation is tested and corrected if necessary. Thus the deposited HTML code is checked for correctness and corrected.  

With the ModelManagement Library in Dymola the style of the models is checked. 

#### Clean the Modelica [CleanUpSkripts](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/02_CITests/CleanUpSkripts)
Removes any files that were created when running simulations in Dymola, such as *.mat or dymola.log


## Folder 
The folder contains the subfolder 01_BaseFunction, 02_CITests, 03_Whitelists, 04_Documentation, 05_Templates and 06_Configfiles. 

### 1 BaseFunction
This folder contains all important Scripts and Functions that are builded for the CI Tests. The Scripts are not in use, feel free to work with the functions and overwrite them. 

### 2 CITests
This folder contains all CI Tests for AixLib in GitLab within UnitTests, SyntaxTest and CleanUpScripts
For more information view this [CI Tests](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/02_CITests).

### 3 WhiteLists
This folder contains [WhiteLists](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/03_WhiteLists), which are not included in the CITests.


### 4 Documentation
This folder contains [documentation](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/04_Documentation) on the CI, e.g. how new tests can be integrated or relevant commands for the CI 

### 5 Templates
This folder contains [Templates](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/05_Templates) for the CI tests implemented so far. The following example can be used to implement the tests in the CI. 


	#!/bin/bash
	image: registry.git.rwth-aachen.de/ebc/ebc_intern/dymola-docker:miniconda-latest

	stages:
		- build
		- HTMLCheck
		- openMR
		- deploy
		- StyleCheck
		- Check
		- Simulate
		- RegressionTest

	include:
		- project: 'EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates'
		- file: 'bin/05_Templates/check_model.gitlab-ci.yml'
		- project: 'EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates'
		- file: 'bin/05_Templates/check_simulate.gitlab-ci.yml'
		- project: 'EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates'
		- file: 'bin/05_Templates/regression_test.gitlab-ci.yml'
		- project: 'EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates'
		- file: 'bin/05_Templates/html_check.gitlab-ci.yml'
		- project: 'EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates'
		- file: 'bin/05_Templates/style_check.gitlab-ci.yml'


The templates are also implemented under the following repository [Templates](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_all/gitlab_ci/templates)

### 6 Configfiles

This folder contains [Config files](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/sven.hinrichs/GitLabCI/tree/master/bin/06_Configfiles) which are used for the CI.
